Our dataset is based on the Taipei City Transportation Bureau's 2020 traffic accident data. We selected a few important columns (such as age, gender, and number of injuries) for analysis.

This program is used to detect bias in data. 
We mainly detect bias in Taipei's 2020 traffic accident data, using the number of injuries as an indicator. 
We found that the presence or absence of the 'accident type and type' field can bias the prediction of the number of injuries.
